## 🏁 **Let’s start with** Basics! (Beginner level)

### Introduction To Big Data Analysis
    
Data Engineers come into play when companies needs to handle in a reproducible way large amounts of data so that they can then be streamlined to data analysts and scientists in order to understand past trends and make predictions. 

But first of all what is Big Data?

Let's check some **Big Data Analysis Resources!** 👉🏻  https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/blog10/

When working with large amounts of data it can then become impossible to perform any form of analysis on a single machine and that’s why using hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs, IPUs, etc…) or parallelizing execution across a cluster of machines is fundamental.

Once having become familiar with the different kinds of acceleration techniques, it can then be possible to create ad hoc benchmarks to evaluate which approach might be best for your own use case.

A good resource in order to gain a birds-eye view of the Data Engineering landscape is “**Fundamentals of Data Engineering**” by Joe Reis and Matt Housley or the “Data Engineering Zoomcamp” by **Alexey Grigorev**.

### Python
    
Nowadays Python is indubitably one of the most ubiquitous programming languages when working with Data. Therefore it vital to have some familiarity with it in order to work in the data space:

Once having learned the basics, we can then start focusing on how to write efficient code in Python:

In order to create reproducible code and avoid libraries versioning issues, it is then necessary to understand how environments can be created and managed in Python and when using Anaconda:
